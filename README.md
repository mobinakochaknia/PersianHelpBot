# PersianHelpBot-
PersianHelpBot is an AI-powered chatbot designed to automate employee inquiries in Persian. Instead of calling the companyâ€™s hotline, employees can ask their questions directly through the bot.

The system is powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. It uses sentence embeddings to semantically search through tagged Q&A data and parsed PDF documents stored in a vector database. By combining semantic retrieval with LLM-based response generation, PersianHelpBot delivers accurate, context-aware answers to company-specific queries.
